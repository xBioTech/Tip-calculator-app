## Overview

### The project

this is a fully responsive Tip Calculator Web app designed to help users calculate the appropriate tip amount based on the total bill, the number of people sharing the bill, and the desired percentage of the tip.

This project was created as part of the Odin Project curriculum, an open-source web development education platform. The purpose of this project was to learn and practice new web development skills.

## My process

I added some small code snippets below to illustrate my workwise

```css

  /* some code*/
}

.people-form:focus {
  /* some code*/
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* some code*/
}
```
